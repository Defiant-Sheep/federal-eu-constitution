# TITLE I - Fundamental Rights and Freedoms

## Chapter I - General Principles

### Article I. 
No government body or actor shall enact, enforce, or tolerate policies, actions, or practices that directly or indirectly result in oppression, marginalization, or unfair treatment of any individual or group based on their ethnicity, gender, social class, sexual orientation, political opinion, religion, disability, or any other protected personal or social condition or circumstance explicitly recognized by this constitution. This includes failing to take reasonable and practicable steps to remedy instances of systemic or enduring actions or conditions that unjustly disadvantage an individual or group, or adopting measures that, without legitimate and proportionate justification, deny equality of opportunity or the protections guaranteed by law.

Government bodies shall take proactive measures to ensure that all citizens, irrespective of such personal or social conditions or circumstances, are equal before the law and enjoy the same rights and freedoms without discrimination, and in the event of conflict between the rights of different groups, steps shall be taken to resolve them in a way that respects the dignity and freedoms of all parties, while giving priority to the principle of non-prejudice and ensuring that no one's fundamental rights are subordinated to prejudicial or discriminatory practices on the part of others.

### Article II. 
No government body or actor shall in any way restrict the fundamental freedoms, namely freedom of thought, conscience, press and expression, which are inalienable and guaranteed to all citizens; it shall ensure that all individuals can enjoy them.
