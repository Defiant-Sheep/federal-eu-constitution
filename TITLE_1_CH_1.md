## Chapter I - General Principles

### Article I. 
Any government body or actor shall ensure that all citizens, regardless of their ethnicity, gender, social class, sexual orientation, political opinion, religion or any other personal or social condition or circumstance, are equal before the law and enjoy the same rights and freedoms without discrimination. No government body or actor shall enact, enforce, or tolerate policies, actions, or practices that result in oppression or unfair treatment of any individual or group on the basis of such personal or social conditions or circumstances

### Article II. 
No government body or actor shall in any way restrict the fundamental freedoms, namely freedom of thought, conscience, press and expression, which are inalienable and guaranteed to all citizens; it shall ensure that all individuals can enjoy them. This includes the freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any form of media without interference, censorship or prior restraint by government or other authorities, regardless of frontiers. Restrictions must be in accordance with the law.

### Article III. 
No government body or actor, nor any private or public entity, shall restrict the freedom of the press, which shall be guaranteed in all its forms, including print, broadcast, and digital media. Journalists shall have the right to access sources of information in accordance with the law. Such laws must be narrowly tailored, transparent, and fully comply with constitutional guarantees of press freedom, and must not be used to create undue barriers to journalistic work or access to public information.

Journalists shall be protected in the exercise of their professional duties, including investigative reporting, opinion writing, and whistleblowing, provided they act in good faith and in the public interest. The independence of the press and the confidentiality of journalistic sources shall be inviolable, except in cases where disclosure is clearly and narrowly necessary to prevent imminent harm to life or address specific and serious criminal activity. Disclosure may only occur under the review and approval of an independent and impartial judicial body, and affected journalists shall have the right to contest such decisions.

The government shall ensure a pluralistic media landscape free from undue concentration of ownership by establishing and enforcing clear regulatory frameworks. Such frameworks must be subject to independent oversight and shall include provisions for transparency in media ownership to prevent covert monopolies or excessive influence by any entity, public or private. Media outlets shall not face retaliatory actions, such as selective taxation, targeted licensing, or disproportionate penalties, for lawful reporting or criticism of the government.

The government shall publish an annual report detailing actions taken to regulate the media landscape, including any restrictions applied, with clear justifications and an assessment of their proportionality and necessity. This report shall be reviewed by an independent oversight body to ensure transparency and accountability.
