# TITLE V - Justice and the Rule of Law

## Chapter I - Judicial Independence and Structure

### Article 1. 
The Constitutional Court shall be the highest authority with regards to the interpretation of this constitution. It shall require a two-thirds majority to make any decision. All other courts shall not interpret this constitution contrary to decisions made by the Constitutional Court, unless the Constitutional Court made a more recent decision permitting the other court's interpretation, or the decision by the Constitutional Court is blatantly ignoring the text of this Constitution.

### Article 2.
Each member state shall appoint two members of the Constitutional Court. State law shall determine how their members are appointed and removed. They mey be joined by a list of judges selected by the federation. 

A list of up to fifteen nominees to the Constitutional Court may be proposed by three-fifths of either the European Parliament, the European Senate or the incumbant Constitutional Court. A period of one month shall be given for other lists to be proposed, and then a period of around one month shall be given for ballots to be written for a public referendum. Voters may approve of any combination of lists and/or the removal of the incumbant list without replacement, or they may indicate preferral of the incumbant list to all other available options. If any list is approved by over two-thirds of the vote, all judges on the list with the most approvals are appointed to the Constitutional Court. If there was an incumbant list, any member of the incumbant list that was not on the newly selected list is removed from the Constitutional Court. If no list was approved by over two-thirds of the votes but the removal of the incumbant list was approved by two-fifths of the vote, the incumbant list is removed from the Constitutional Court. Otherwise, nothing changes.
