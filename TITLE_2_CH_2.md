The President of Europe may at any time nominate any citizen who is not a member of the Consilium to be a minister of a defined ministry or an ambassator to a foreign country. If there is a vacancy for a minister or ambassator, any Vice President may nominate any citizen who is not a member of the Consilium to be that minister or ambassator.

The President may at any time remove any minister from office. The President may grant the right to remove ministers to the Vice Presidents. 

If there is no president, a majority of Vice Presidents may appoint a citizen as president

### Article II. 
The Parliament of Europe may appoint and remove a Federal Chancellor by an absolute majority. 

If a majority of Parliament votes in for a motion of no confidence against a minister or any group of ministers, the minister or ministers will be removed from office.

Individuals nominated as ministers require either a majority vote of Parliament, or the approval of a Federal Chancellor, before they are appointed to their position.

### Article III.
Individuals nominated as ambasators require a two-thirds affirmative vote of the Senate before they may be appointed to their position.

### Article IV.
Either chamber of the Consilium may initiate bills according to their internal rules. They may debate and amend the bill through their internal rules at any point before it is finalised. The initiating chamber may pass the bill with a majority vote. The bill is sent to the other chamber, that may debate it themselves. They second chamber may by majority vote reject the bill, return it to the first chamber with a recommendation to amend it, or pass the bill themselves. The bill becomes law after both chambers pass it in the same form.

The senate may choose to submit a bill to a referendum.

### Article V.
Two thirds of the Senate must vote in favour if the ratification of a treaty is to occur. If a treaty contains legislative provisions, Parliament must also ratify the treaty for it to come into effect. 

### Article VI.
Each chamber of the Consilium may edit their internal rules. 

Each chamber of the Consilium may elect their own speaker and deputy speakers.

### Article VII.
Laws that grant additional power to the cabinet, a minister or a ministry shall be called Enabling Acts. 
Enabling Acts may contain clauses restricting the use of these powers to specific types of state of emergency. There shall be legislation describing the process by which every type of state of emergency may be declared and revoked.

Either chamber of the Consilium may unilaterally create restrictions to Enabling Acts. These restrictions may be removed at any time by the same chamber.


### Article VIII.
The Federal Jury has juristiction over the impeachments of the President of Europe, the Vice Presidents, ministers, ambassators and members of the Supreme Court. Members of the Federal Jury may only vote on the impeachment of a federal official once per month. The votes will be sorted based on the meeting they were cast after and the individual they were about, but the individuals who voted a certain way within a meeting will remain anonymous. Votes in favour of impeachment shall not be legally distinguishable even if they specified separate actions as the relevant offence, but the media may report on the reasoning given if the layout of the votes allows for the reasoning to be given. 

If two-thirds of the votes among the Federal Jury within the past two months on the topic of a single federal official voted to impeach them, and at least three-quarters of the Federal Jury participated in a vote on that same federal official within the past two months, then the official is considered impeached. An impeached official shall be removed from office when a judge declares that they are aware that they have been impeached. 

Being impeached shall not necessarilty be a crime, and impeachable offenses are not necessarily crimes. The ordinary justice system will be used to determine if the actions the Federal Jury accused the former federal official of were committed beyone a reasonable doubt, and if they were criminal actions.
