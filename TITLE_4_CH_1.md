New commissioners for each class shall be selected by sortition among the citizens of the member state until there are ten commissioners in each class the year that this constitution comes into effect, and immediately after the longest serving class is removed. 

The senatorial nominations comission of each member state shall set their own rules for their meetings, the rules for determining who they interview, and the rules determining how they will choose the candidates, and the number of candidates they will nominate. These rules may be changed by a majority vote. If there are are more citizens being proposed by members of the comission than they agreed they would nominate, they will choose at least six to nominate by single transferrable vote, and the remainder will be nominated by a method decided by the comission. All these nominations must be complete by a month before the election.

The candidates for the senatorial election are all incumbant senators who wish to run for reelection and all candidates chosen by the senatorial nominations comission.

Four senators shall elected by the citizens of each member state from these candidates using single transferrable vote.

The lower house of the legislature of each member state shall elect their member state's first four senators through single transferrable vote soon after this constitution comes into effect. 

The timing of elections for the senate shall be determined by state law, but shall not be more than seven years and two months after the previous election. The first senate election of each member state shall not occur longer than five years after the latter time period out of the ratification of this constitution and the enterance of the member state to the European Federation.

### Article II.
Voting for the European Parliament shall occur in two elections, the constituency elections and the list elections.

Member states with more than 4 million residents shall devide themselves into constituencies of between 2.4 million and 3.8 million residents. Member states with less than 4 million residents shall be one constituency each. Constituencies shall be entitled to elect one member of Parliament for every 600 thousand residents. If a member state has fewer than 2.4 million residents, they will be entitled to exactly 3 members of Parliament. 
Every four years, the citizens of each constituency will elect as many members of Parliament as they are entitled to by single transferrable vote.

Every three years, the citizens of the European Federation shall vote for European parties in the list election. Seats in Parliament shall be distributed to the parties according to the Sainte-Langue method until there are 800 members of parliament.


### Article III
If there are more than nine member states that have never nominated a presidential candidate in the past ten years, the senate shall select nine of these member states to nominate candidates for the first round of the presidential election. Otherwise, all member states that never nominated a presidential candidate candidate in the past ten years are automatically selected. 

All of the selected member states shall nominate between two and four eligible presidential candidates by the time that three years have elapsed from the inauguration of the previous President. Eah member state shall create the rules governing how this happens.
The incumbant President of Europe may nominate one eligible candidate for the election by the same deadline. They are permitted to nominate themself if they are eligible.


Three to four months after the nominations, the first round of the election will begin. All citizens of Europe may choose to approve any number and combbination of candidates, and may choose to disapprove of any number and combination of candidates. The results shall be tallied for each member state.

1. Each candidate is assigned a state ratio in each member state that is the ratio of approvals to disaprovals of the candidate in the state. Each candidate will be assigned a federal ratio that is their largest state ratio such that two thirds of the candidate's state ratios are equal to or greater than their federal ratio. The candidate with assigned the largest federal ratio is sent to the second round.
2. The candidate for whom the most approvals minus disaprovals outside of the member state that nominated them is then entered into the second round.
3. The ballots are then recounted, with each ballot being weighted such that their voting power is twelve divided by one mose than the number of candidates the ballot approved that are already sent to the second round. The candidate for whom the combined voting power of the approvals minus the combined voting power of the disapprovals is greatest is sent to the second round.
4. Part 3 is repeated, accounting for the winner of Part 3. 


The second round occurs begins four to six months after the first round. Voters will use ranked ballots, allowing equal rankings.
1. The votes are first counted for the candidates that they ranked first. If one candidate secures the majority of votes, they win the election.
2. The candidates are ordered according to how many people voted for them in round 1, with candidates with less votes coming earlier in the ordering.
3. The first two candidates in the ordering are compared, counting the number of votes that preferred one over the other. Ballots that did not rank a candidate are considered to prefer all ranked candidates over all unranked candidates. The candidate who was preferred by more candidates than preferred the other wins this count.
4. A count with the same rules happens between the winner of the previous count and the next candidate in the ordering.
5. The winner of Part 4 is compared to the candidate who recieved the most votes in part 1, with the same rules as parts 3 and 4. The winner wins the election.


The winner of the election, as defined in the second round, becomes the President of Europe when the incumbant president's term ends, and when one year has elapsed from the date that this constitution comes into effect. The term of an elected president ends four years after their inauguration. The term of a president appointed by the Vice Presidents due to a vacancy ends four years after the previous election.

### Article IV.
Every citizen or former citizen of the European Federation over the age of twenty who is not a member of the Consilium and has not served more than six years as President of Europe is eligable to be a presidential candidate and may be appointed Vice President.

### Article V.
Single Transferrable Vote shall be defined as follows:

Voters vote using ranked ballots. No candidates are considered elected or eliminated at the start. All ballots begin with equal voting power. The threshold is the number of votes cast divided by one more than the number of candidates who will win. 

The following process occurs until the number of elected candidates is equal to the number of positions to be filled.
1. Votes are assigned to the candidate they ranked highest who has not been elected or eliminated. Ballots that ranked a set of candidates equally have their voting power split equally between all of the candidates in the highest ranking that have not been elected or eliminated.
2. If a candidate recieved a greater combined voting power than the threshold, that candidate is elected immediately. The voting power of every ballot for this candidate is multiplied by the ratio of the combined voting power assigned to the candidate minus the threshold divided by the combined voting power assigned to the candidate.
3. If no candidate recieved a greater sum of voting powers than the threshold, the candidate whose sum of voting power of the votes assigned to them is eliminated.
4. If not all seats are filled, return to step 1.
