New commissioners for each class shall be selected by sortition among the citizens of the member state until there are ten commissioners in each class the year that this constitution comes into effect, and immediately after the longest serving class is removed. 

The senatorial nominations comission of each member state shall set their own rules for their meetings, the rules for determining who they interview, and the rules determining how they will choose the candidates. These rules may be changed by a majority vote. Any group among the comissioners may nominate candidates up to the number of comissioners in the group divided by six. The majority of the senatorial nominations comission may forbid members of these groups from voting in the selection of other candidates. All these nominations must be complete at a month before the election

The candidates for the senatorial election are all incumbant senators who wish to run for reelection, all candidates chosen by the senatorial nominations comission, and all candidates nominated by groups of the senatorial nominations comission. 

Four senators shall elected by the citizens of each member state from these candidates using single transferrable vote.

The timing of elections for the senate shall be determined by state law, but shall not be more than seven years and two months after the previous election. The first senate election of each member state shall not occur longer than five years after the latter time period out of the ratification of this constitution and the enterance of the member state to the European Federation.

### Article II.
Voting for the European Parliament shall occur in two elections, the constituency elections and the list elections.

Member states with more than 4 million residents shall devide themselves into constituencies of between 2.4 million and 3.8 million residents. Member states with less than 4 million residents shall be one constituency each. Constituencies shall be entitled to elect one member of Parliament for every 600 thousand residents. If a member state has fewer than 2.4 million residents, they will be entitled to exactly 3 members of Parliament. 
Every four years, the citizens of each constituency will elect as many members of Parliament as they are entitled to by single transferrable vote.

Every three years, the citizens of the European Federation shall vote for European parties in the list election. Seats in Parliament shall be distributed to the parties according to the Sainte-Langue method until there are 800 members of parliament.


### Article III
If there are more than nine member states that have never nominated a presidential candidate in the past ten years, the senate shall select nine of these member states to nominate candidates for the first round of the presidential election. Otherwise, all member states that never nominated a presidential candidate candidate in the past ten years are automatically selected. 

All of the selected member states shall nominate between two and four presidential candidates by the time that three years have elapsed from the inauguration of the previous President. Eah member state shall create the rules governing how this happens.
The incumbant President of Europe may nominate one candidate for the election by the same deadline. They are permitted to nominate themself if it would not be their third term as President of Europe. 


Three to four months after the nominations, the first round of the election will begin. All citizens of Europe may choose to approve any number and combbination of candidates, and may choose to disapprove of any number and combination of candidates. The results shall be tallied for each member state.

1. Each candidate shall be assigned a number that is the largest number such that the ration of approvals to disaprovals of the candidate is greater than or equal to the number two thirds of all member states. The candidate with assigned the largest number is sent to the second round.
2. The candidate for whom the most approvals minus disaprovals outside of the member state that nominated them is then entered into the second round.
3. The ballots are then recounted, with each ballot being weighted such that their voting power is twelve divided by one mose than the number of candidates the ballot approved that are already sent to the second round. The candidate for whom the combined voting power of the approvals minus the combined voting power of the disapprovals is greatest is sent to the second round.
4. Part 3 is repeated, accounting for the winner of Part 3. 


The second round occurs begins four to six months after the first round. Voters will use ranked ballots.
1. The votes are first counted for the candidates that they ranked first. If one candidate secures the majority of votes, they win the election.
2. The candidates are ordered according to how many people voted for them in round 1, with candidates with less votes coming earlier in the ordering.
3. The first two candidates in the ordering are compared, counting the number of votes that preferred one over the other. Ballots that did not rank a candidate are considered to prefer all ranked candidates over all unranked candidates. The candidate who was preferred by more candidates than preferred the other wins this count.
4. A count with the same rules happens between the winner of the previous count and the next candidate in the ordering.
5. The winner of Part 4 is compared to the candidate who recieved the most votes in part 1, with the same rules as parts 3 and 4. The winner wins the election.


The winner of the election, as defined in the second round, becomes the President of Europe when the incumbant president's term ends. This happens four years after the previous inauguration.

### Article IV.
Single Transferrable Vote shall be defined as follows:

Voters vote using ranked ballots. No candidates are considered elected or eliminated at the start. All ballots begin with equal voting power. The threshold is the number of votes cast divided by one more than the number of candidates who will win. 

The following process occurs until the number of elected candidates is equal to the number of positions to be filled.
1. Votes are assigned to the candidate they ranked highest who has not been elected or eliminated.
2. If a candidate recieved a greater combined voting power than the threshold, that candidate is elected immediately. The voting power of all votes for this candidate is multiplied by the threshold divided by the combined voting power of the votes assigned to the candidate.
3. If no candidate recieved a greater sum of voting powers than the threshold, the candidate whose sum of voting power of the votes assigned to them is eliminated.
4. If not all seats are filled, return to step 1.
